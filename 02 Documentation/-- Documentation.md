# Description of 'School-git' database project:<br>

### Main goals:
* Every teacher can lead more than one subject (Przedmiot).
* Every student can have more than one subject and more than one note from that.
* Every every teacher can have lesson with more than one student.


---

With '#' I named my workbook files, where I learnt and tried side-commands, not really used in code of files from steps of my project.

### Steps:
1. I designed datababase of school in Draw.io and exported to *.jpg file.<br>

2. I created 'School_DB' database

<u>I type first queries to create main tables:</u><br>
+ Student (<https://github.com/git-atoms/School-git/blob/master/02%20Documentation/01%20Student.sql>)
+ Przedmiot (<https://github.com/git-atoms/School-git/blob/master/02%20Documentation/02%20Przedmiot.sql>)
+ Nauczyciel (<https://github.com/git-atoms/School-git/blob/master/02%20Documentation/03%20Nauczyciel.sql>)
+ Kierunek Studi√≥w (<https://github.com/git-atoms/School-git/blob/master/02%20Documentation/04%20Kierunek%20studi%C3%B3w.sql>) <br>

(*For better practice, I do not use ready, right-mouse-button commands or solutions and no COPY-PASTE because I write everything myself everytime in SSMS query window.*)<br>
