### Steps:
1. I designed datababase of school in Draw.io and exported to *.jpg file.<br>

2. I created 'School_DB' database

<u>I type first queries to create main tables:</u><br>
+ Student
+ Przedmiot
+ Nauczyciel
+ Kierunek Studi√≥w <br>

(*For better practice, I do not use ready, right-mouse-button commands or solutions and no COPY-PASTE because I write everything myself everytime in SSMS query window.*)<br>
