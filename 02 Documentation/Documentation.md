# Description of 'School-git' database project:<br>

### Main goals:
* Every teacher can lead more than one subject (Przedmiot).
* Every student can have more than one subject and more than one note from that.
* Every every teacher can have lesson with more than one student.



### Steps:
1. I designed datababase of school in Draw.io and exported to *.jpg file.<br>

2. I created 'School_DB' database


I type first queries to create main tables:<br>
+ Student
+ Przedmiot
+ Nauczyciel
+ Kierunek Studi√≥w <br>

(*For better practice, I do not use ready, right-mouse-button commands and write everything myself i SSMS query window.*)<br>
